What it does:



Crazy and super simple iPod Shuffle Player for iPhone
Things to add:
1. Add the ability to start the Music library from ios even when the Music app is not runnning in background - (Have no clue how to do that still trying to figure that out)
2. Volume control with UIButtons not sliders in ios 9 because volume control with MPMusicPlayerController is no longer supported in ios 8 and 9. - (Again seaching up how to do this)
3. If you want to contribute to help improve/help me add these features I would be very happpy :)
4. Change the type of iPod Shuffle color with a UIButton
